    <h2>Hello Fellow Gamers</h2>
    <p>This is my personal review site. I grew up playing video games. I played a lot with my older brother who also had 
    a passion for video games and it was a way to connect with him. I also had plenty of friends to play with and it was 
    always a great time. Anybody remember the James Bond 007 days? Screen looking, big heads? Ahhh, good times.</p>
    <p>In this website, as you can see above, you can look at a review of one of my favorite games of all time, a list of my favorite games, a way to contact me and a little bit about myself. If anything of this interest you, please go ahead and explore my site. Let me know what you think, and I hope you enjoy what you see.</p>

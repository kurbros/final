    <h2>Written by Justin Kurilla</h2>
    <p>This series went on quite the adventure. The first God of War came out on the Playstation 2 in 2005. This game started it 
    all. With its heavy and bloody combat, its mythological storytelling and it's unique man character Kratos. Kratos, the God of War 
    is the centerpiece of this series and unlike most main characters, is brutal in his approach. This series became so popular 
    because of this.</p>
    <p>What makes this game so special was how it reinvented itself. This is no easy task as the path of least resistance 
    like the continuation in the art direction and basic gameplay, we see a reinvention on every aspect of this game.</p>
    <h2>Combat</h2>
    <p>The combat is similar to its past games in the series but not really at the same time. In the previous games you get 
    a dual-wielding axe that allows you to combat multiple enemies which you can take down quickly in a satisfyingly brutal way. 
    But the game now offers more features and content that gives it a new feeling and allows for innovative ways to tackle your foes. 
    One of which is the Leviathan Axe. What makes this axe so unique is that you can throw it then call it back to your grasp 
    as the axe continues to damage its foes on its way back. This makes the weapon very deadly and fun to use. 
    You also get to punch your foes in such a fluid way you don't even realize you are unarmed and can switch between the two 
    without even noticing.</p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>God of War offers Kratos as expected. But the game also introduces your little companion called Atreus. Atreus is Kratos's son 
    who uses a bow and arrow as his main weapon. Atreus adds to the combat because you get to command him when to show his arrows which can damage 
    and most importanly disrupt the foe in its tracks. The story starts off with the funeral of Kratos's wife. Her one wish was for her ashes 
    to be taken to the highest peak and to be thrown off. What happens between then is the journey of the game. For the first time in the series 
    Kratos becomes three dimensional. The games before it struggled to add depth to Kratos. But with the addition to his son, this adds a lot 
    more to Kratos as he struggles to be a dad.</p>
    <h2>Verdict</h2>
    <p>God of War is a masterpiece. It is very difficult to reimigane a game in a series with a strong foundation. 
    The God of War series looked to be running out of steam until this game came along. I can't think of anything better 
    than what this game has brought to us. With zero loading screens and a one shot direction. It is a master class 
    and a game that will be my favorite for a long time.</p>
